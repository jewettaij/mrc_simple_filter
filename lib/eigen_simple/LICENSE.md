Eigen License Details
====================
The code in this directory was adapted from "Eigen".
"Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: 
 matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms."
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org
(Eigen is quite large.  The code in this directory is a simplified version
 which removes the many dependencies on other files from the Eigen library.)

Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
COPYING.* files here.

All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.
