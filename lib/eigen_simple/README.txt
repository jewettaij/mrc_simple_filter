The "eigen3_simple.hpp" and "lin3_utils.hpp" source files
were originally located here.
They have since been moved into the "../visfd/" directory.

The license information for the "eigen3_simple.hpp" file
is still located here, along with the license' supporting files.

The "eigen3_simple.hpp" file was adapted from "Eigen".
