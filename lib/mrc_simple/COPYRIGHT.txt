Programs were written by David Mastronarde, James Kremer, Rick
Gaudette, Sue Held, Quanren Xiong, and John Heumann at the University 
of Colorado, some based on work and libraries from the MRC.  We thank David
Agard and Hans Chen for the original MRC source code, Wah Chiu for a Unix
version of low-level MRC file routines used in the FORTRAN parts, and Chuck
Robertson for much work on the port to Linux.

This work was supported in the past by NIH P41 grants from NCRR and NIGMS to
J. Richard McIntosh and Andreas Hoenger; and by NIBIB grant EB005027 to
